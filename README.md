# Chip Input Component

## Overview
This project is a chip input component developed using ViteReactJS and styled with Tailwind CSS. The chip input component allows users to input text in a search box, which dynamically searches from a static dataset provided. Users can create chips by pressing enter after typing in the search box, and they can remove the created chips. Duplicate chips are not allowed, meaning once added, they won't show in the popover. The component also provides autosuggestions with blue highlights as the user types.
